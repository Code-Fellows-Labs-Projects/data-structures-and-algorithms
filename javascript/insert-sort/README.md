# Insertion-Sort

## Problem Domain

Insertion Sort is a function that takes in an unsorted array and sorts it in ascending order. It traverses through the array comparing the current element's value to the previous element, moving the current element in front of the previous element if it's value is smaller. It continues through the entire array until the end is reached.
